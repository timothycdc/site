excerpt:  "A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes."

## The Basics

You should be able to _do this_ and **this** - basic formatting options. Wierdly, there is no underline in markdown - so no need to do that.

Next, you should be able to create links - like [this](https://standup-philosophy.netlify.app/) - that link will go to the standup philosophy blog I have.

### Lists

Two types of lists...

1. Ordered lists
2. Like this.
3. Because numbers.

And...

- Unordered lists
- like this
- No numbers.
- Just bullet points

### Code

You can put `code` in Markddown...

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
}
```




#### Bash Time

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define source and destination directories. I increase the length of this lineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
src_dir="/path/to/source"
dest_dir="/path/to/destination"

# Function to copy files
copy_files() {
  src_file=$1
  dest_file=$2
  cp "$src_file" "$dest_file"
}

# Iterate over each item in source directory
for item in "$src_dir"/*; do
  # If item is a file
  if [ -f "$item" ]; then
    echo "File found: $item"
    # Call the copy function
    copy_files "$item" "$dest_dir"
  # If item is a directory
  elif [ -d "$item" ]; then
    echo "Directory found: $item. Skipping."
  else
    echo "Unknown item: $item. Skipping."
  fi
done

echo "Done copying files."
echo "Done copying files."
echo "Done copying files."
echo "Done copying files."
echo "Done copying files."

```

This script copies only files, skipping over directories and other types of items. It's always a good idea to check the behavior of a script like this before running it on important data, to avoid unexpected results.



<Aside>I chose this video to test my theme. I did this to myself</Aside>
<Aside>PS: I think this song slaps.</Aside>

 ```jsx numberLines hl=1-3,5 title=src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
 import React from 'react'
 import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'

 export default ({ children, className }) => {
   const language = className.replace(/language-/, '') || ""
   return (
     <Highlight {...defaultProps}
       code={children}
       language={language}
     >
       {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
         <pre className={className} style={{ ...style }}>
           {tokens.map((line, index) => {
             const lineProps = getLineProps({ line, key: index })
             return (
               <div key={index} {...lineProps}>
                 {line.map((token, key) => (
                   <span key={key}{...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                 ))}
               </div>
             )
           }
           )}
         </pre>
       )}
     </Highlight>
   )
 }
 ```

## More testing
```jsx
const IndexPage = (props) => {
  const allBuildTimeJasons = props.data.JasonAPI.allJasons;
  const { loading, data: apolloData } = useQuery(APOLLO_QUERY);
  const allClientTimeJasons = apolloData.allJasons;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Look at all these Jasons!</h1>
      {loading ? (
        <JasonList grayOutWaveCount jasons={allBuildTimeJasons} />
      ) : (
        <JasonList jasons={allClientTimeJasons} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Or a single line?

```bash
npm i -D eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

Would you prefer it if the copy button wasn't there? Can do!

```bash noCopy
npm i eslint
```

### Line highlighting? Got it!

Line 4 is **lit**.
Gettit?

```js hl=4
const getShouldHighlightLine = (hl) => {
  if (hl) {
    const lineNumbers = rangeParser(hl);
    return (index) => lineNumbers.includes(index + 1);
  }
  return () => false;
};
```






This is a paragraph with a footnote at the end. [^1]

Here's another sentence with a footnote. [^2]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote. You can put as much text here as you like, including multiple paragraphs.
