          I focus on a multidisciplinary approach, rapidly building up
          understanding in varied fields of knowledge to combine their
          applications advantageously, while maintaining high level to detail.
          On this page I write about my interests, log progress, share
          experiments, and try to keep everything accessible in one place.
